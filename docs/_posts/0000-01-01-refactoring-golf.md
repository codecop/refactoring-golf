## What is refactoring?

> Code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code—changing the factoring—without changing its external behavior.

## What is Refactoring Golf?

> Refactoring Golf is a game designed to stretch your refactoring muscles and get you to explore your IDE to see what's really possible using shortcuts and automation.

## What is Refactoring Golf?

+ Aim is to complete a series of holes using the least strokes possible
+ The repository contains several source trees, or numbered holes based on a single exercise
+ Each hole follows from the previous one
+ Goal is to safely and efficiently as possible refactor the current hole’s code to look like the next hole’s code
+ A stroke is essentially a change made to the code, and every stroke costs you points

---

## Rules: points

+ **1 point** for every change made to the code using a shortcut or automated IDE feature (e.g., an automated refactoring, code template, or Find/Replace)
+ **2 points** for every manual edit. Note that a single *edit* could cover multiple lines of code
+ **Double points** for every change made *while the code cannot pass the tests* after the previous change
+ **Zero points** for code formatting (e.g., deleting whitespace or optimizing imports)

Note: This information is in the README

--

## Rules: continued

+ Allow yourselves a **maximum of 2 attempts** at each round to determine your best score
+ Work as a pair and swap roles each hole (or as and when you want to)
+ One person codes, one person scores
+ We’ll gather scores after each hole and discuss
+ 10 minutes per hole, then five minutes to discuss
