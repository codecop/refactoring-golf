+ Practicing using your tools 👍
+ Practicing your craft/techniques 👍
+ ~~Winning~~ Having fun 👍

Note: Practicing and fun. Not everyone enjoys competition—this is not about winning.

## Introduction

What isn’t this workshop about?

+ Convincing you that TDD is a good thing 👎
+ Learning to code 👎
+ Learning what good code is 👎

Note: These are all good things, but we have limited time.

## What is refactoring?

> Code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code—changing the factoring—without changing its external behavior.

—[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring)

## If you don’t know how to refactor…

[Source Making](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring) has a great site about refactoring.

Feel free to ask others for help—the aim is to learn.

## What is Refactoring Golf?

> Refactoring Golf is a game designed to stretch your refactoring muscles and get you to explore your IDE to see what's really possible using shortcuts and automation.

## What is Refactoring Golf?

+ Aim is to complete a series of holes using the least strokes possible
+ The repository contains several source trees, or numbered holes based on a single exercise
+ Each hole follows from the previous one
+ Goal is to safely and efficiently as possible refactor the current hole’s code to look like the next hole’s code
+ A stroke is essentially a change made to the code, and every stroke costs you points

---

## How to play: points

+ **1 point** for every change made to the code using a shortcut or automated IDE feature (e.g., an automated refactoring, code template, or Find/Replace)
+ **2 points** for every manual edit. Note that a single *edit* could cover multiple lines of code
+ **Double points** for every change made *while the code cannot pass the tests* after the previous change
+ **Zero points** for code formatting (e.g., deleting whitespace or optimizing imports)

Note: This information is in the README. Send link to the README via chat so they have a scoring reference: https://github.com/autotraderuk/refactoring-golf/blob/master/README.md

--

## How to play: continued

+ Work as a group and share attempts
+ Someone codes, someone else scores
    + Note what steps you take to get your best score
+ We’ll gather after each hole and discuss
+ About ten minutes per hole, then about five to discuss

--

## Getting set up

+ Clone <https://github.com/autotraderuk/refactoring-golf>
+ Use either VS Code or IntelliJ—it’s up to you
    + VS Code has a nice built in pairing feature

Note:
    Since the intent is practicing, people may want to stick with the IDE they are familiar with.  
    Possible to do Java with VS Code.

+ Record is three strokes

--

# Hole Two

How did people do? Would anyone like to share?

+ Record is seven strokes

--

# Hole Three

How did people do? Would anyone like to share?

+ Record is five strokes

--

# Hole Four

How did people do? Would anyone like to share?

+ Record is six strokes
